### ü§ñ AI Recommendation Technology

#### Intelligent Context Management
Our AI recommendation system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized solar system design advice. Key technologies include:

- **Contextual Awareness**: 
  - Maintains a rolling conversation history
  - Tracks user inputs across different calculation stages
  - Understands the evolving context of the solar system design

- **Adaptive Recommendation Engine**:
  - Uses OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding
  - Generates context-aware recommendations based on:
    1. Current system specifications
    2. User's technical expertise
    3. Specific design constraints
    4. Historical conversation context

- **Dynamic Query Handling**:
  - Interprets complex user queries about solar system design
  - Provides technical explanations and practical recommendations
  - Offers suggestions for optimization and component selection

#### NLP-Driven Personalization
The recommendation system employs sophisticated NLP techniques:
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately identifies user's underlying questions
- **Contextual Embedding**: Converts user inputs into meaningful vector representations
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understands nuanced technical requirements
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combines user inputs with comprehensive solar system design knowledge

#### Example Recommendation Scenarios
1. **Load Assessment**:
   - Analyzes entered loads
   - Suggests energy-efficient alternatives
   - Recommends optimal inverter and battery configurations

2. **Technical Queries**:
   - Explains complex solar system design concepts
   - Provides real-time technical guidance
   - Offers system optimization strategies

3. **Constraint Handling**:
   - Identifies potential design limitations
   - Suggests alternative component selections
   - Provides cost-effective recommendations

#### Privacy and Security
- All AI interactions are processed securely
- User data is not stored beyond the current session
- Recommendations are generated in real-time without persistent data retention
