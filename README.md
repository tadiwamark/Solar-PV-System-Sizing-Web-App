# Solar PV System Sizing Web Application

## Overview
This web application helps users design and size their solar photovoltaic (PV) system by providing comprehensive calculations for loads, inverters, battery banks, and solar panels. Leveraging Streamlit and AI-powered recommendations, the app offers both standard and technical user experiences.

## Features
- üîã Load Input Management
  - Add multiple electrical loads with detailed specifications
  - Calculate total energy demands (day and night)
  - Track peak power and power surge requirements

- üîå Inverter Sizing Calculations
  - Automatically determine inverter size based on total load
  - Recommend appropriate system voltage

- üîã Battery Bank Sizing
  - Calculate battery bank requirements
  - Determine number and configuration of batteries
  - Support for different battery technologies

- ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Panel Calculations
  - Estimate total solar panel wattage needed
  - Recommend number and configuration of panels
  - Consider peak sun hours and system efficiency

- üìä Comprehensive System Summary
  - Detailed breakdown of system components
  - Visualization of system configuration
